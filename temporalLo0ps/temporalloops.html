      <h1>
        Conscious Plants?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Are the greenthings of nature, plants, bushes, ferns, trees, mosses, etc., conscious? <br><br>
        Can we even approach this question without knowing what human consciousness is? Although we don't know what human consciousness is, or how it relates to the brain, a common assumption is that brains are necessary for consciousness. <br><br>
        Since plants do not have brain tissue, from this viewpoint it is useless to even consider the possibility of plants being conscious. The article by Cleve Backster (1968) on the 'primary perception ability' of plants,and the best selling book The Secret Life of Plants, by Peter Tomkins & Christopher Bird (1974) have stimulated popular reconsideration of plant consciousness. Earlier works had already provoked discussion among scientists, including Nannq, or The Soul Life of Plants, by the famous German physician and psycho-physicist Gustav Fechner (1848, reprinted l92l), and work ofthe Indian Jagadis Chander Bose on plants' sensitivity to injuries (Geddes, 1920; Tompkins & Bird,l974, pp.95-117). From the 1920's onward, theosophist Geoffrey Hodson (1976;1994) wrote, lectured and showed paintings ofhis clairvoyant perceptions oftrees and plants. <br><br>
        The idea of plants and trees being more than the mere play of physico-chemicalforces did not die with the end of the Middle Ages, when witches and druids had knowledge of the esoteric dimension of plant life (Engel, 1978;Vickery, 1995). Still today in a world filled with scientific knowledge, where year af√Øer year, with noconsideration ofplant consciousness, plant sciences gain beautiful insights in plants'internal physiology, and crop yields improve as results of fertilizer treatments, weedand pest management, new varieties, mechanization, irrigation and drainage methods-the idea that plants and trees might after all be conscious beings rather than merelyliving objects is still very widely held. New streams of support are found in New Age literature. <br><br>
        Some people claim to have acquired sensitivity on subtle levels, where they can feel plants' and trees' energies. These views have been applied in gardening and agricultural methods, with results convincing them that plant consciousness is a fact.The purpose of this paper is neither to defend nor to attack such claims, but to analyse the concept of'plant consciousness' and argue that it ought to be studied seriously. <br><br>
        A debate on the subject is worthwhile either way: if plant consciousness were shown to exist, it would profoundly affect ail kinds of biological research and agricultural methods, and open a fascinating aspect ofnature to the plant sciences; on the other hand, if it were shown not to exist, an important step would have been taken towards eradicating an erroneous but still powerful folk-belief. We should also note that active concern for issues like environmental pollution is often shown by those believing plants to be conscious organisms. Even though this belief might not be based on fact, it remains a strong motivation for such people. In order to understand their response to environmental challenges, it is necessary to understand their beliefs, including their beliefin plant consciousness. <br><br>
        Plant consciousness is not taken seriously by mainstream scientists, microbiologists, ecologists, ethnobotanists, or scholars of human and animal consciousness, but it is discussed in a wide variety of sometimes obscure publications, often in superficial or very speculative ways. <br><br>
        The present paper is an exploration into this unknown territory of sometimes peculiar, and poorly investigated aspects of plant life - aspects claimed to be pointing towards the fact of plant consciousness, but usually without defining consciousness in general or plant consciousness in particular. <br><br>Developing such definitions, and making plans for further research, is necessary and will provide material for other papers. The purpose here is the preliminary one of surveying and classifying the various views of plant consciousness.
